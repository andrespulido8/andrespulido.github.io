I'm a second year PhD student in [APRILab](https://aprilab.mae.ufl.edu/) at  
the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu), 
advised by Assistant Professor [Jane Shin](https://mae.ufl.edu/people/faculty/primary/profiles/jane-jaejeong-shin/). I am also involved
in the Machine Intelligence Lab [(MIL)](http://subjugator.org/), where I have worked in the mechanical and software team for four years. 
 
Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering also from University of Florida in May 2021.

Research interests:

- Robotics motion planning
- Reinforcement learning
- Learning-based Robotics
- Optimal and adaptive control
